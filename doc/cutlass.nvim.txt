Cutlass overrides the delete operations to actually just delete and not affect
the current yank.

It achieves this by overriding the following keys to always use the black hole
register: `c`, `cc`, `C`, `s`, `S`, `d`, `dd`, `D`, `x`, `X`. Note that if you
have already mapped these keys to something else (like we do below with `x`)
then it will not change it again.

This plugin already exists <https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass> in
vimscript. I hope this version in lua will be more efficient :)

USAGE                                                     *cutlass.nvim-usage*

Requires neovim > 0.5.0.

Using https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim:

>
    use({
      "gbprod/cutlass.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("cutlass").setup({
            cut_key = "m"
        })
      end
    })

CONFIGURATION                                     *cutlass.nvim-configuration*

`CUT_KEY` ~

Default : `nil`

After setting up this plugin, all of these operations will simply delete and
not cut. However, you will still want to have a key for 'cut', which you can
add by setting the `cut_key` value when setting up the plugin. (`m` or `x` are
recommended)

This will create those bindings :

>
    nnoremap m d
    xnoremap m d
    nnoremap mm dd
    nnoremap M D
<


`OVERRIDE_DEL` ~

Default : `nil`

By default, this plugin doesn’t remap the `<Del>` key to use the blackhole
register (and it will work as the old `x` key). By setting `override_del` to
true, `<Del>` key will not cut any more and not afect your current yank.

INTEGRATION                                         *cutlass.nvim-integration*

If you have svermeulen/vim-yoink <https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink>
installed, it will work seemlessly as original svermeulen/vim-cutlass
<https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass>. Just follow the integration
instructions
<https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink#integration-with-vim-cutlass>.
