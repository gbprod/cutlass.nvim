<https://github.com/gbprod/cutlass.nvim/actions/workflows/integration.yml>

Cutlass overrides the delete operations to actually just delete and not affect
the current yank.


✨ FEATURES                   *cutlass.nvim-✂️-cutlass.nvim-✨-features*

It overrides the following keys to always use the black hole register: `c`,
`C`, `s`, `S`, `d`, `D`, `x`, `X`.

Note that if you have already mapped these keys to something else (like we do
below with `x`) then it will not change it again.

This plugin already exists <https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass> in
vimscript. I hope this version in lua will be more efficient :)


⚡️ REQUIREMENTS     *cutlass.nvim-✂️-cutlass.nvim-⚡️-requirements*


- Neovim >= 0.7.0

(For Neovim 0.5 compatibility, you can use the compat-0.5
<https://github.com/gbprod/cutlass.nvim/tree/compat-0.5> branch)


📦 INSTALLATION         *cutlass.nvim-✂️-cutlass.nvim-📦-installation*

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:


LAZY ~

>lua
    -- Lua
    {
      "gbprod/cutlass.nvim",
      opts = {
          -- your configuration comes here
          -- or don't set opts to use the default settings
          -- refer to the configuration section below
        }
    }
<


PACKER ~

>lua
    -- Lua
    use({
      "gbprod/cutlass.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("cutlass").setup({
          -- your configuration comes here
          -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
          -- refer to the configuration section below
        })
      end
    })
<


VIM-PLUG ~

>vim
    " Vim Script
    Plug 'gbprod/cutlass.nvim'
    lua << EOF
      require("cutlass").setup({
        " your configuration comes here
        " or leave it empty to use the default settings
        " refer to the configuration section below
      })
    EOF
<


⚙️ CONFIGURATION   *cutlass.nvim-✂️-cutlass.nvim-⚙️-configuration*

Cutlass comes with the following defaults:

>lua
    {
      cut_key = nil,
      override_del = nil,
      exclude = {},
      registers = {
        select = "_",
        delete = "_",
        change = "_",
      },
    }
<


CUT_KEY ~

Default : `nil`

After setting up this plugin, all of these operations will simply delete and
not cut. However, you will still want to have a key for 'cut', which you can
add by setting the `cut_key` value when setting up the plugin. (`m` or `x` are
recommended)

This will create those bindings :

>vimscript
    nnoremap m d
    xnoremap m d
    nnoremap mm dd
    nnoremap M D
<


OVERRIDE_DEL ~

Default : `nil`

By default, this plugin doesn’t remap the `<Del>` key to use the blackhole
register (and it will work as the old `x` key). By setting `override_del` to
true, `<Del>` key will not cut any more and not affect your current yank.


EXCLUDE ~

Default: `{}`

For some reason, you may doesn’t want `cutlass` to override some keys, you
can exclude mappings to be set by adding this to the exclude option using
format `"{mode}{key}"`.

Eg. If you want to exclude `s` key in normal mode, sets `exclude` option to `{
"ns" }` ; If you want to exclude `<bs>` key in select mode, sets `exclude`
option to `{ "s<bs>" }`.


REGISTERS ~

Default:

>
    {
      select = "_",
      delete = "_",
      change = "_",
    }
<

Installing `cutlass.nvim` will use blackhole register for delete, change and
select actions. But maybe you want to redirect to a specific register, this
option allows you to choose the register to use for each action.

E.g. using configuration above will use `s` register for select, `d` for delete
and `c` for change:

>lua
    {
      registers = {
        select = "s",
        delete = "d",
        change = "c",
      },
    }

🤝 INTEGRATION           *cutlass.nvim-✂️-cutlass.nvim-🤝-integration*

svermeulen/vim-yoink ~

If you have svermeulen/vim-yoink <https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink>
installed, it will work seemlessly as original svermeulen/vim-cutlass
<https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass>. Just follow the integration
instructions
<https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink#integration-with-vim-cutlass>.

ggandor/lightspeed.nvim and ggandor/leap.nvim ~

When you’re using plugins like ggandor/lightspeed.nvim
<https://github.com/ggandor/lightspeed.nvim> or ggandor/leap.nvim
<https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim>, you should not want cutlass to remap
the `s` key. You can do this using the `exclude` option:

>lua
    use({
      "gbprod/cutlass.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("cutlass").setup({
            exclude = { "ns", "nS" },
        })
      end
    })
