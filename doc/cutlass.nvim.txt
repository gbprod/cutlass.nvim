Cutlass overrides the delete operations to actually just delete and not affect
the current yank.

✨ FEATURES                                       *cutlass.nvim-✨-features*

It overrides the following keys to always use the black hole register: `c`,
`C`, `s`, `S`, `d`, `D`, `x`, `X`.

Note that if you have already mapped these keys to something else (like we do
below with `x`) then it will not change it again.

This plugin already exists <https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass> in
vimscript. I hope this version in lua will be more efficient :)

⚡️ REQUIREMENTS                         *cutlass.nvim-⚡️-requirements*


- Neovim >= 0.5.0


📦 INSTALLATION                             *cutlass.nvim-📦-installation*

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

PACKER <HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/WBTHOMASON/PACKER.NVIM> ~

>
    -- Lua
    use({
      "gbprod/cutlass.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("cutlass").setup({
          -- your configuration comes here
          -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
          -- refer to the configuration section below
        })
      end
    })
<


VIM-PLUG <HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/JUNEGUNN/VIM-PLUG> ~

>
    " Vim Script
    Plug 'gbprod/cutlass.nvim'
    lua << EOF
      require("cutlass").setup({
        -- your configuration comes here
        -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
        -- refer to the configuration section below
      })
    EOF
<


⚙️ CONFIGURATION                       *cutlass.nvim-⚙️-configuration*

Cutlass comes with the following defaults:

>
    {
      cut_key = nil,
      override_del = nil,
      exclude = {},
    }
<


`CUT_KEY` ~

Default : `nil`

After setting up this plugin, all of these operations will simply delete and
not cut. However, you will still want to have a key for 'cut', which you can
add by setting the `cut_key` value when setting up the plugin. (`m` or `x` are
recommended)

This will create those bindings :

>
    nnoremap m d
    xnoremap m d
    nnoremap mm dd
    nnoremap M D
<


`OVERRIDE_DEL` ~

Default : `nil`

By default, this plugin doesn’t remap the `<Del>` key to use the blackhole
register (and it will work as the old `x` key). By setting `override_del` to
true, `<Del>` key will not cut any more and not afect your current yank.

`EXCLUDE` ~

Default: `{}`

For some reason, you may doesn’t want `cutlass` to override some keys, you
can exclude mappings to be set by adding this to the exclude option using
format `"{mode}{key}"`.

Eg. If you want to exclude `s` key in normal mode, sets `exclude` option to `{
"ns" }` ; If you want to exclude `<bs>` key in select mode, sets `exclude`
option to `{ "s<bs>" }`.

🤝 INTEGRATION                               *cutlass.nvim-🤝-integration*

svermeulen/vim-yoink ~

If you have svermeulen/vim-yoink <https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink>
installed, it will work seemlessly as original svermeulen/vim-cutlass
<https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass>. Just follow the integration
instructions
<https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink#integration-with-vim-cutlass>.

ggandor/lightspeed.nvim ~

When you’re using plugins like ggandor/lightspeed.nvim
<https://github.com/ggandor/lightspeed.nvim>, you should not want cutlass to
remap the `s` key. You can do this using the `exclude` option:

>
    use({
      "gbprod/cutlass.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("cutlass").setup({
            exclude = { "ns", "nS" },
        })
      end
    })
